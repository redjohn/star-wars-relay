# Star Wars Relay Server

This is an implementation of the GraphQL backend for the 
[Relay Star Wars example app](https://github.com/relayjs/relay-examples/tree/master/star-wars). 
To use this instead of the backend provided in the example, edit `server.js` in the `star-wars`
project and have it proxy `/graphql` to `http://localhost:4000`.
